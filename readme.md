# Self-hosting
1. Get a lamp VPS or server setup. About 1GB should be fine for memory.
2. Clone this repo into any directory.
3. Run `./sync-website.sh`. This will move all the relavant files into the hosting directory
4. Run **todo.sh**. This will populate the sql database. For testing, use the `-t` flag to also populate testing data.
